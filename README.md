# Final-Project
Price Prediction model for cryptocurrency

Cryptocurrency Price Prediction

Overview
This project aims to predict the prices of cryptocurrencies using machine learning techniques. By leveraging historical price data, trading volume, and other relevant features, we build models to forecast future price movements. 

Features
Data collection from kaggle
Data preprocessing and feature engineering
Implementation of various machine learning models
Evaluation of model performance
Prediction of future cryptocurrency prices
Visualization of results

Data Preprocessing
Data Cleaning: Removed missing values, handled outliers, and normalized the data.
Feature Engineering: Created features like moving averages,Focus on time-based features like trends and seasonality. 
Time Series Decomposition: Decomposed the price data into trend, seasonality, and residual components to better understand underlying patterns.

Libraries 

Python 3.6+
pandas
numpy
scikit-learn
matplotlib
seaborn
requests

Modeling Approach
The project utilized a combination of traditional time series models and modern machine learning techniques, including:
ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)
cross validaation (time series)
LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)

Results
The models were tested on historical data, and their predictions were compared against actual market prices. The results demonstrate the potential of machine learning models in forecasting cryptocurrency prices, with deep learning models like LSTM showing strong performance in capturing complex patterns.
