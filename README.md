Data
The dataset used in this project includes historical price data for various cryptocurrencies. The data can be obtained from sources such as Kaggle.


Models
The project explores several machine learning models, including:

Linear Regression
Decision Trees
Random Forest
Gradient Boosting
LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory Networks)
Each model is evaluated based on its performance metrics such as RMSE, MAE, and RÂ² score.

Results
The results of the model predictions are visualized using various plots to show the accuracy and performance over time.
